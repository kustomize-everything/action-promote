# action-promote

This GitHub action provides a standard promotion pattern using Kustomize.

It supports injecting multiple new images or helm charts into target overlays
via a JSON config file. For examples, refer to [example](./example).

Within a JSON config for your image promotions, you have two (mutually exclusive
on a per-image name basis) ways of providing the promotion information. Either
you can give the `newName` or `newTag` keys directly in the
image configuration OR you can give a `fromOverlay` key, which will find
the overlay provided as the value in your deployment repo and extract the value
of the image `name` from it.

For each image, you can promote multiple target overlays in your deployment
repo by providing multiple values to the `overlays` key.

Within a JSON config for your Helm chart promotions, you have two (also mutually
exclusive on a per-image name basis) ways of providing the promotion
information. Either you can give the new `version` for the chart directly (along
with an optional update to the `releaseName`) or, similar to the images
promotion configuration, you can provide a `fromOverlay` key, which will find
the overlay provided and extract the helm chart information from that overlay
for use in the provided `overlay`.

After making all of the changes specified in the JSON configuration, the GitHub
action will automatically commit and either push the branch directly or open
a pull request, depending on what you define.

## Usage
