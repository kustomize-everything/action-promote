`action-promote` is a GitHub action designed to implement a standard promotion
pattern using Kustomize.

It facilitates the injection of multiple new images or helm charts into target
overlays through a JSON config file. The action supports both cross-overlay
promotions using the `fromOverlay` field and direct image/helm tag promotions.

## Promotion Configuration

For each promotion type, you can target multiple overlays in your deployment
repository by providing multiple values to the `overlays` key.

### Image Promotions

Images can be promoted in two ways:

1. **Cross-Overlay Promotion**: Extract image details from a given overlay and
   promote it to one or more target overlays.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "nginx",
    "fromOverlay": "env/dev",
    "overlays": ["env/production"]
  }
]
```

1. **Direct Image Tag Promotion**: Directly promote an image by specifying its
   new name and tag.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "nginx",
    "newName": "nginx",
    "newTag": "1.25.0",
    "overlays": ["env/dev"]
  }
]
```

### Helm Chart Promotions

Helm charts can also be promoted in two ways:

1. **Direct Helm Promotion**: Specify a new version for the helm chart directly
   (along with an optional `releaseName`).

```json
[
  {
    "name": "kube-prometheus-stack",
    "releaseName": "prometheus",
    "version": "45.5.0",
    "overlays": ["env/dev"]
  }
]
```

1. **Cross-Overlay Helm Promotion**: Extract helm details from a given overlay
   and promote it to one or more target overlays.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "kube-prometheus-stack",
    "fromOverlay": "env/dev",
    "overlays": ["env/production"]
  }
]
```

For more examples, refer to the [example](./example) directory.

After processing the specified promotions in the JSON configuration,
`action-promote` will commit the changes and either push directly or open a pull
request, based on your specification.

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

- A Github repository where your code resides, e.g.,
  [kustomize-everything/guestbook](https://github.com/kustomize-everything/guestbook).
- CI process resulting in a container image and tag.
- Github repository where your Kustomize deployment files reside, e.g.,
  [kustomize-everything/guestbook-deploy](https://github.com/kustomize-everything/guestbook-deploy).

### Inputs and Outputs

For the detailed list of action inputs and outputs, refer to
[action.yml](./action.yml).

### Example Workflow

For a complete workflow example, see

Note: The `images` input uses the JSON configuration specified above.
